                        There's been a murder. The murderer was a man, he is over six feet, in the prime of his
                        life, small feet for his height, wore rough square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly
                        cigar. He came here with his victim in a four- wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with
                        three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a
                        florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a
                        few indications, but they may assist you.<p class="textName">Sherlock</p>
